CS-275 notes, written in markdown.
exported to PDF.
no fancy formatting, so the PDFs are kinda ugly.

if you have a latex compiler in your brain, by all means use notepad++ and hallucinate the latex as you see fit.

for all others use a program that can render latex as well as markdown
I use https://obsidian.md

will be updated continously.
if you would like, clone the repo and fix errors etc. and maybe create pull requests

will be likely be taken down at the end of semester


to replicate it the way I use it (to minimise errors) download obisdian, clone this repo, and open this folder as theobsidian vaule. 


I may also include an ANKI deck if people would like.

all notes are currently not complete.
